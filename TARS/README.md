# TARS is Another Robot Simulator
A ROS multi-agent simulator based on the Social Force Model (SFM). It includes two types of agents:

* **Humans** move randomly between points of interest following the A* algorithm for global planning and the SFM for local planning. The graph structure is given by the user, the edge weights are dynamic and depends on the length of the corresponding edge and the number of humans in transit. The desired velocity and the list of points of interest in the map can be configured individually for each agent.

* Dual-wheeled **robots** following velocity commands. Each robot publish its own odometry, laser scan and people detection. Each one is subscribed to its own *cmd_vel* topic to receive velocity commands. The robot radius, number of laser scan readings, laser scan range and people detection range can be configured individually for each one.

The simulator has been developed as a lightweight ROS package and includes cool RVIZ visualization, the number of dependencies has been minimized for optimal execution. It has been successfully tested on ROS Noetic, Melodic and Kinetic.

## Social Force Model

The SFM used by TARS is based on the model proposed by Helbing and Molnar:

-  Helbing, Dirk & Molnar, Peter. (1998). *Social Force Model for Pedestrian Dynamics*. Physical Review E. 51. 10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282. 

## Installation and quick start

Clone this repository in the source folder of your catkin workspace and compile with catkin_make. Packages *map_server* and *rviz* are recommended.

1. cd \~/catkin_ws/src
2. git clone https://github.com/Ignacio-Perez/TARS 
3. cd ..
4. catkin_make

You can launch a test scenario as follows:

1. roslaunch tars ccia_h.launch
